I do want to be grown up, but it does scare me so that sometimes I don't want to be. I do want to be in love with Will, but sometimes I wish I wasn't so that I didn't think about him all the time.

Learn to be alone and to like it. There's nothing more freeing and empowering than learning to like your own company.
