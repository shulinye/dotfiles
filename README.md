dotfiles
========

Personal dotfiles - created so I can set up a new computer quickly

Geared mostly towards ubuntu or ubuntu-based systems.

###bashrc/zshrc

Both of these import `.rc_common`.

Some bits and pieces pulled from various places around the web. 

###scripts

Mostly in python.

###License
